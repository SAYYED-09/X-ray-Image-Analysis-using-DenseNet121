# X-ray Image Classification

## 📝 Project Overview
This project is a deep learning-based image classification model that analyzes chest X-ray images and classifies them into three categories:
- **COVID-19**
- **Pneumonia**
- **Normal**

The model leverages **TensorFlow** and **OpenCV** for image processing and classification. It was developed as part of my internship at **Postulate Info Tech**.

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow**
- **OpenCV**
- **NumPy & Pandas**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**

---

## 📌 Features
- Image preprocessing using OpenCV (resizing, normalization)
- CNN model for classification
- Dataset augmentation to improve model accuracy
- Evaluation using test images

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or other medical image repositories.
